# A/B Test Setup

A/B Test Setup is a 3RDWRONG specialist for ad creative, activated only when its registry trigger applies.

## What it does

- The source describes it as: When the user wants to plan, design, or implement an A/B test or experiment, or build a growth experimentation program. Also use when the user mentions "A/B test," "split test," "experiment," "test this change," "variant copy," "multivariate test," "hypothesis," "should I test this," "which version is better," "test two versions," "statistical significance," "how long should I run this test," "growth experiments," "experiment velocity," "experiment backlog," "ICE score," "experimentation program," or "experiment playbook." Use this whenever someone is comparing two approaches and wants to measure which performs better, or when they want to build a systematic experimentation practice. For tracking implementation, see analytics. For page-level conversion optimization, see cro.
- Not just "let's see what happens".
- Specific prediction of outcome.

## When to use

- Use for the named audit, measurement, compliance, or reporting task when its evidence and data source are available.
- Limit use to studio demand or campaign creative/review tied to a specifically approved client launch; founder approval is required before any spend.

## When not to use

- Do not treat this tool as authority to launch, change or fund a campaign.
- Do not use without a defined studio-demand or approved client-launch scope and the source data required by the tool.

## Inputs it needs

- A specific brief and requested decision or deliverable.
- The source file’s required evidence and context, with links/paths and date or version where relevant.
- An approved campaign scope; founder approval before spend.

## How to run it

1. Check the registry role, job and trigger against the request.
2. Gather the required inputs from approved sources; keep client data outside the public repository.
3. Invoke the tool using the host-specific name above and give it the brief and evidence paths.
4. Have someone other than the maker review the output against the checks below.

```text
Use A/B Test Setup to prepare the documented campaign creative or test deliverable. Scope: {studio demand or named client launch}. Brief and decision: {brief}. Evidence/assets: {links or paths}. Founder approval is required before any spend; do not initiate or authorise spend. Mark missing evidence Unknown and follow the tool's documented output format.
```

## What good output looks like

- The result follows the tool file’s stated purpose and output structure.
- Evidence and assumptions are distinguishable; missing facts remain Unknown.
- A human owner can review the result and decide the next action.

## Quality checks

- [ ] The request matches the registry job and, for a specialist, its trigger.
- [ ] Claims, numbers and decisions have traceable evidence; unknowns are labelled.
- [ ] A reviewer other than the maker checks the result before use.
- [ ] No spend action occurs without founder approval.

## Pairs with

- `agency:marketing-growth-hacker` — same job; use when its own role or trigger applies.
- `agency:marketing-livestream-commerce-coach` — same job; use when its own role or trigger applies.
- `agency:paid-media-creative-strategist` — same job; use when its own role or trigger applies.

## Limits and cautions

- Only capabilities and restrictions documented in the tool file are attributed to it; anything else is Not documented.
- Keep evidence labels distinct: Documented, Interpretation, Hypothesis and Unknown. Maker ≠ checker.
- Advertising covers studio demand and creative/review work for specifically approved client launches; it is not standalone ads management.
- No spend without founder approval. Treat campaign exports and client information as confidential; never put client data in the public repository.
