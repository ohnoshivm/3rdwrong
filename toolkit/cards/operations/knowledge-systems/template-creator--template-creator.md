# Template Creator

A specialist for document production at 3RDWRONG, called when Create or update a reusable personal Codex artifact-template skill. Use when the user invokes $template-creator or asks in natural language to create a reusable template from a reference document, presentation, spreadsheet, Google Docs, Slides, or Sheets link, ImageGen or Product Design image, email, Slack message, or Site project, or explicitly asks to edit or update a passed artifact-template skill. Do not use for one-off creation from an existing template.

## What it does

- Create or update a reusable personal Codex artifact-template skill. Use when the user invokes $template-creator or asks in natural language to create a reusable template from a reference document, presentation,…
- Manage only personal skills under `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills`.
- Create a new template by default. Use a numbered skill name instead of overwriting an existing template.
- Update only when the user explicitly asks to edit or update exactly one passed artifact-template skill. Treat that passed skill as the exact target; never choose a similarly named template.

## When to use

- Use when the approved work needs this capability: Create or update a reusable personal Codex artifact-template skill. Use when the user invokes $template-creator or asks in natural language to create a reusable template from a reference document, presentation, spreadsheet, Google Docs, Slides, or Sheets link, ImageGen or Product Design image, email, Slack message, or Site project, or explicitly asks to edit or update a passed artifact-template skill. Do not use for one-off creation from an existing template
- In a 3RDWRONG project, use during the relevant document production task and pass its output to the project owner for review.

## When not to use

- Do not use when the request falls outside document production or fails the registered specialist trigger.
- Do not use its output as client approval, verified research or professional advice.
- For the paired documents:documents work, use that tool and hand off this artefact.

## Inputs it needs

- The named document type or template, its purpose, audience and required format.
- Relevant documents, source links and constraints; keep client records and personal data in the approved private store.

## How to run it

1. Check the task against the registered job and trigger.
2. Read the source instructions and provide the minimum necessary inputs.
3. Invoke the tool using the name above and request the required artefact.
4. Have a separate reviewer check evidence, accuracy, privacy and fit before hand-off.

```text
Use template-creator:template-creator. Task: {task}. Project phase: {phase}. Context and source material: {links/files and constraints}. Deliverable: {format and audience}. Follow the tool's documented instructions; distinguish evidence from interpretation, state unknowns and do not claim approval.
```

## What good output looks like

- The deliverable addresses the requested task and follows the source-documented workflow.
- Facts, assumptions and unknowns are distinguishable; no capability is implied beyond the source.

## Quality checks

- [ ] The task fits the registry job and any specialist trigger.
- [ ] A reviewer other than the maker checked the output and source evidence.
- [ ] Assumptions and unknowns are visible; unsupported claims are removed.
- [ ] No client-confidential data or personal information entered the public repository.

## Pairs with

- `documents:documents` — coordinate the hand-off for the same job; pass the artefact and constraints.

## Limits and cautions

- Capabilities are limited to those documented in the source; ask for unknown details rather than assuming them.
- Human review remains responsible for factual accuracy, suitability and approval.
- Distribution: Not documented; availability: codex. Confirm setup or sign-in requirements before relying on the tool.
