# Hook Development

A specialist for skill authoring at 3RDWRONG, called when This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", "use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}", "set up event-driven automation", "block dangerous commands", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Notification). Provides comprehensive guidance for creating and implementing Claude Code plugin hooks with focus on advanced prompt-based hooks API.

## What it does

- This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", "use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}", "set up event-driven…
- Validate tool calls before execution (PreToolUse)
- React to tool results (PostToolUse)
- Enforce completion standards (Stop, SubagentStop)

## When to use

- Use when the approved work needs this capability: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", "use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}", "set up event-driven automation", "block dangerous commands", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Notification). Provides comprehensive guidance for creating and implementing Claude Code plugin hooks with focus on advanced prompt-based hooks API
- In a 3RDWRONG project, use during the relevant skill authoring task and pass its output to the project owner for review.

## When not to use

- Do not use when the request falls outside skill authoring or fails the registered specialist trigger.
- Do not use its output as client approval, verified research or professional advice.
- For the paired skill-creator:skill-creator work, use that tool and hand off this artefact.

## Inputs it needs

- The target skill, agent, plugin or command and its repository/context, plus the requested create/review outcome.
- Relevant documents, source links and constraints; keep client records and personal data in the approved private store.

## How to run it

1. Check the task against the registered job and trigger.
2. Read the source instructions and provide the minimum necessary inputs.
3. Invoke the tool using the name above and request the required artefact.
4. Have a separate reviewer check evidence, accuracy, privacy and fit before hand-off.

```text
Use plugin-dev:hook-development. Task: {task}. Project phase: {phase}. Context and source material: {links/files and constraints}. Deliverable: {format and audience}. Follow the tool's documented instructions; distinguish evidence from interpretation, state unknowns and do not claim approval.
```

## What good output looks like

- The deliverable addresses the requested task and follows the source-documented workflow.
- Facts, assumptions and unknowns are distinguishable; no capability is implied beyond the source.

## Quality checks

- [ ] The task fits the registry job and any specialist trigger.
- [ ] A reviewer other than the maker checked the output and source evidence.
- [ ] Assumptions and unknowns are visible; unsupported claims are removed.
- [ ] No client-confidential data or personal information entered the public repository.

## Pairs with

- `skill-creator:skill-creator` — coordinate the hand-off for the same job; pass the artefact and constraints.

## Limits and cautions

- Capabilities are limited to those documented in the source; ask for unknown details rather than assuming them.
- Human review remains responsible for factual accuracy, suitability and approval.
- Distribution: vendor; availability: claude. Confirm setup or sign-in requirements before relying on the tool.
