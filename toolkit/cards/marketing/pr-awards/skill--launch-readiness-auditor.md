# Launch Readiness Auditor

Launch Readiness Auditor is 3RDWRONG’s lead for launch gate in pr awards.

## What it does

- The source describes it as: Use when the user asks to "audit our launch plan", "are we ready to launch", or evaluate launch execution/outcomes; runs one typed RAMP preflight, execution, or outcome profile without mixing time horizons. Not for recording launch state — use launch-registry; not for running launch day — use launch-day-conductor. 发布就绪审计/RAMP分阶段评估/发布前放行.
- Before a committed launch/announcement when go/no-go evidence is needed.
- During/after the launch window when execution quality must be assessed.

## When to use

- Use as lead for launch gate when the studio has an approved brief for this deliverable.
- For awards, work only on free entries and keep the final submission for founder review.

## When not to use

- Do not pay for award entries or submit without founder review.
- Do not use to make unsupported claims about recognition, results or approval.

## Inputs it needs

- A specific brief and requested decision or deliverable.
- The source file’s required evidence and context, with links/paths and date or version where relevant.
- Award criteria, deadline, cleared project evidence and confirmation that entry is free.

## How to run it

1. Check the registry role, job and trigger against the request.
2. Gather the required inputs from approved sources; keep client data outside the public repository.
3. Invoke the tool using the host-specific name above and give it the brief and evidence paths.
4. Have someone other than the maker review the output against the checks below.

```text
Use Launch Readiness Auditor for launch gate at 3RDWRONG. Context: {studio or specifically approved project}. Brief and decision: {brief}. Source material: {links/files}. Follow the tool's documented deliverable, separate sourced facts from interpretation, and mark unknowns. Do not invent evidence or approval.
```

## What good output looks like

- The result follows the tool file’s stated purpose and output structure.
- Evidence and assumptions are distinguishable; missing facts remain Unknown.
- A human owner can review the result and decide the next action.

## Quality checks

- [ ] The request matches the registry job and, for a specialist, its trigger.
- [ ] Claims, numbers and decisions have traceable evidence; unknowns are labelled.
- [ ] A reviewer other than the maker checks the result before use.
- [ ] Any award entry is free and the founder reviews the final submission.

## Pairs with

- No same-job peer appears in this scoped registry slice.

## Limits and cautions

- Only capabilities and restrictions documented in the tool file are attributed to it; anything else is Not documented.
- Keep evidence labels distinct: Documented, Interpretation, Hypothesis and Unknown. Maker ≠ checker.
- Award submissions are free-only for now; do not recommend or incur entry fees.
